# Calendar Day view component - React App with Typescript

ðŸš€ A Calendar component offers a comprehensive day view of a calendar, showcasing a list of events while adhering to two important constraints.   
Firstly, for events that overlap, they are assigned an identical width, ensuring consistency in their visual representation.  
Secondly, each event dynamically utilizes the maximum available width while adhering to the first constraint.
